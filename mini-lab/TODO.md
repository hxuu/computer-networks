# ‚úÖ TODO - GNS3-Based Automated Network Configuration Interface

This file outlines the key tasks required to complete the mini-lab project for *R√©seaux 2* using `.gns3` files for topology-aware network automation.

---

## üìÅ Project Structure Setup

- [x] Initialize Flask project structure
- [x] Create folders: `templates/`, `static/`, `uploads/`, `assets/`, `app/`
- [x] Create main files: `main.py`, `routes.py`, `gns3_parser.py`, `automation.py`
- [x] Add and test `requirements.txt`

---

## üîÑ GNS3 File Handling

- [x] Implement file upload route
- [x] Validate `.gns3` file type
- [x] Store uploaded file in `/uploads`
- [x] View `.gns3` as topology:
    - [x] Parse the .gns3 as a json file and extract useful info
    - [x] Create the YAML file to be used with drawthe.net
    - [x] Convert the YAML file into a picture
    - [x] Render that picture to the user
- [x] Parse `.gns3` JSON to extract SSH/console connection info (host, port, credentials)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automation Interface

- [x] Centralize the parsing algorithm for yaml, info table conversion
- [x] Create sub parts (info table, config options) and append to global html
- [x] Add form for configuration alongside file to upload

---

## üöÄ Backend Automation

- [x] Parse the config information to be passed to `automation.py`
- [ ] Build `automation.py` with:
  - [ ] Group the config files content (commands) and their related information (name,port) in a new file for the automation script
  - [ ] Modify already existing scripts (rip.py...etc) to have a single interface of configuration (take a config file, parse into commands...etc)
  - [ ] Unify the experience with `automation.py` (handle case by case)
  - [ ] Pass everything to the `automation.py` script
  - [ ] Ensure automation.py gives feedback on state of configuration
